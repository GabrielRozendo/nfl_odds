# NFL Odds

A simple script to help me choose a NFL Team for survivor (a game between friends)
The script get the Odds API and sort by difference DESC (so how far has more chances to win!)

I've just created this repository to myself, it is the reason of some lack of information...
I'll adapt that in future

## Key

Must have a key registered in [https://api.the-odds-api.com](https://api.the-odds-api.com) and put it in APIKEY OS env.
In heroku:
heroku config:set APIKEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE

## TODO

Save my teams in DB to not list (or highlight them)
